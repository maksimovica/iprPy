Method and Theory
-----------------

First, an initial system is generated. This is accomplished by

1. Starting with a unit cell system.

2. Generating a transformed system by rotating the unit cell such that
   the new system's box vectors correspond to crystallographic
   directions, and filled in with atoms to remain a perfect bulk cell
   when the three boundaries are periodic.

3. All atoms are shifted by a fractional amount of the box vectors if
   needed.

4. A supercell system is constructed by combining multiple replicas of
   the transformed system.

Two LAMMPS simulations are then performed that apply an energy/force
minimization on the system, and the total energy of the system after
relaxing is measured, :math:`E^{total}`. In the first simulation, all of
the box's directions are kept periodic (ppp), while in the second
simulation two are periodic and one is non-periodic (ppm). This
effectively slices the system along the boundary plane creating two free
surfaces, each with surface area

.. math:: A_{surface} = \left| \vec{a_1} \times \vec{a_2} \right|

,

where :math:`\vec{a_1}` and :math:`\vec{a_2}` are the two lattice
vectors corresponding to the periodic in-plane directions.

The formation energy of the free surface, :math:`E_{surface}^f`, is
computed in units of energy over area as

.. math:: E_{surface}^f = \frac{E_{ppm}^{total} - E_{ppp}^{total}} {2 A_{surface}}.

The calculation method allows for the specification of which of the
three box dimensions the cut is made along. If not specified, the
default behavior is to make the :math:`\vec{c}` vector direction
non-periodic. This choice is due to the limitations of how LAMMPS
defines triclinic boxes. :math:`\vec{c}` vector is the only box vector
that is allowed to have a component in the Cartesian z direction.
Because of this, the other two box vectors are normal to the z-axis and
therefore will be in the cut plane.
